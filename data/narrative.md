Today, multinational firms are investing enormous amounts of money abroad. These investments are diverse in nature and in importance: they range from a small production plant built by a textile company in a location where labour is cheap, to a fully-fledged research centre established by a high-tech company in a region where there is an abundance of qualified engineers.

These investments are called ***Foreign Direct Investments*** (FDIs) and In 2015 they amounted to 1.8 trillion US dollars [1]. or the equivalent of Italy’s Gross Domestic Product [2].

Almost two thirds of these investments came from industrialised economies, with Europe being the largest investing region ($576 billions in FDI outflows).

What motivates big companies to invest abroad? Why would they set up a factory or a research laboratory outside of their home country?

They want to tap into the specific qualities of a region: they are seeking ***regional strategic assets*** [4].

For instance, the Japanese car manufacturer Nissan decided in 1984 to build a plant in Sunderland, in the North East region of the UK. 

There are several other European localities that Nissan could have chosen: Lazio and Piedmont in Italy, or Nord-Pas-de-Calais in France. They are roughly as rich, populous and educated as the North East.

But Nissan chose the North East for reasons beyond the obvious characteristics of a region: it had many sophisticated auto part suppliers, it was also easier to do business there than in France or Italy, and Nissan could benefit from fiscal arrangements there.

These were the ***regional strategic assets*** of Sunderland in the mid-1980's

On paper, the Bangalore region looked very similar to the nearby province of Punjab in Pakistan, or to the Zheijiang province in coastal China in 1985. What made the balance tilt in favour of Karnataka --the Indian state where Bangalore is-- is its unique concentration of tech talents and its local institutions, conducive to innovative activities.

Nissan, Texas Instruments and all technologically-advanced firms typically seek 3 types of strategic assets when investing abroad: (i) specialised knowledge that is only present in this area, (ii) innovation-prone economic conditions [5] and (iii) favourable local institutional arrangements and norms [6] like a strong enforcement of intellectual property rights and respected patent laws.

While multinational firms from both rich and emerging countries invest abroad to capitalise on regional assets, they do so in different ways.

Firstly, MNEs from developing countries are less likely than those from rich countries to benefit from the technological competence of the region where they invest. As few of them can rival with the technological capabilities of the IBMs, Rolls Royces and Airbuses of the world, they often have a less developed ***absorptive capacity***, needed to fully take advantage of innovation-prone regional factors [6].

Secondly, multinational firms from developing countries tend to invest in cities where a lot of companies are pursuing the same activity in the value chain (R&D or Design and Testing, for instance), but they are not necessarily attracted by cluster or firms in the same industry (automobiles, computers, drugs...).

In sum, multinational companies make their location and investment choices to exploit assets that are specific to a region. In this sense, they clearly benefit from setting a plant abroad. But do the host regions benefit from the newly implanted establishments?

Economists have long seen technological change as one of the most powerful driver of economic development and welfare improvement. It is then crucial to know if developing regions gain from the interventions of technologically-advanced firms. How does the evidence stack up?

One common way to measure the innovative capacity of a city is to count the number of residents who are granted patents.

Based on this statistic, local economies are extremely unequal in their innovation potential. 
The colours on the globe represent the patent counts in 2015, by region. While some regions are innovation hubs, most of the emerged land has no patent [7].

The distribution of patents is not only concentrated in few cities, it is also very stable over time: the most innovative regions in 1975 remained the most innovative in 2005, and very few regions with no patents in 1975 became hubs of innovation over the next four decades.

To study the impact of foreign direct investment on regional patent count, we select a region that receives an FDI by an innovative firm in a given year. We then find another region that looks very similar to the first one in terms of GDP, population and average educational attainment, using a statistical method called ***propensity score matching***.

The regions that receive a foreign intervention ("treated" regions) and those that do not ("counterfactual" regions) are thus almost identical in every observable aspect except the fact that one has been visited by a foreign firm.

In the case of the FDI by Texas Instrument in Bangalore, one can compare the patent count in Bangalore to the average of patent counts in Punjab (Pakistan) and Zehjian (China). Comparing the patent count in the region receiving the FDI to that of the region with no FDI can give us a good idea of the effect of FDI on innovation.

The patent count in regions that receive an intervention does indeed grow more than in regions that remained unvisited by foreign firms.

The graph on the right shows the difference in patent count between the treated and the counterfactual regions (in logarithms). If the blue region is above 0, one can say that the patent count in the treated region is significantly higher.

We aggregate all the years when a foreign company is patenting abroad at time 0 on the graph. Everything to the left of 0 are the years pre-dating the arrival of the foreign firm in the country, everything to the right is the aftermath of the intervention.

Some factors make regions more receptive to foreign firms’ interventions. Foreign direct investments in computers and drugs lead to powerful increases in regional innovation. Innovation in these two technologies relies greatly on collaborations, as FDIs foster collaborations between foreign firms and local firms, as well as among local firms themselves, it is normal to see the largest increases in the most collaborative fields.

#

Furthermore, two continents stand out: Asia and Europe. These continents are those that benefit the most from foreign interventions. Asian and European firms appear to be more likely to absorb the knowledge transmitted through firms investing abroad.

Surpisingly, while Latin America attracts a substantial amount of foreign firms, local economies do not seem to benefit from their presences, in terms of patents.

You can explore the results by technologies and macro regions, using the drop-down menus.

#

Ultimately, the overall impact of FDIs on local innovation is positive: foreign firms help cities and region innovate.

The size of the impact depends largely on the technology and the area of the world where firms operate.
